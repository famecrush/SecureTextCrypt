# TEXT-ENCRYPTER
# Description:

This Python program provides a secure text encryption and decryption utility using the RSA and AES cryptographic algorithms. It allows users to generate RSA key pairs, encrypt text messages with a recipient's public key, and decrypt them using their private key. The program is designed to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive information during transmission and storage.

# Features:

Generate RSA key pairs (private and public keys).
Encrypt text messages with a recipient's public key.
Decrypt encrypted messages using recipient's private key.
Secure handling of encryption keys.

# Usage:

Generate RSA keys: python program.py key --generate --private-key my_private_key.pem
Encrypt text: python program.py encrypt "Your secret message" --public-key recipient_public_key.pem --output-file encrypted_text.bin
Decrypt text: python program.py decrypt encrypted_text.bin --private-key my_private_key.pem
This program is a valuable tool for securing your sensitive communications and data.
